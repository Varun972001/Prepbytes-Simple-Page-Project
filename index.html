    <p class="line-space">Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p class="line-space">
    The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these.After you make your<br>
    choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is<br>
    repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a good state; if<br>
    repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequnece of choices, your final state is a <i>goal</i> state; if<br>
    you ddn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that<br>
    the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get a good leaf. At each noe, beginning with the root, you choose one of its<br>
    children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. 
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Suppose you get a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,<br>
    and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try<br>
    another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>

        <br>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>

        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>

    <p>&#x2022; if no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable</p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf of node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any<br>
    child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on ech child of n. In the above code; this is done by the lines.

    <p class="line-space">
    Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node; it is solvable; if leaf node is not a goal<br>
    node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>

      if the leaf is a goal node, return true
      else return flase
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="line-space">The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. you should understand it thoroughly. Another way of starting it as follows:</p>
    <h4>&#x2022; To search a tree:</h4>
    <ol class="side-space">
        <li>
            If the tree consists of a single leaf; test whether it is a goal node.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have<br>
            searched them all successfully.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="line-space">Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h4>
    <p>
    Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact<br>
    that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language. 
    </p>
    <pre class="line-space">
    boolean solve (Node n){
     put node n on the stack;
      while the stack is not empty{
       if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
          if it is a goal node, return true
           else pop it off the stack 
       }
        else{
         if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
            push the next untried child onto the stack
         else pop the node off the stack
           
      }
     return false    
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
    Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on top of the<br>
    stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence the nodes on the stack at all the times describe a valid path in the<br>
    tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendants. Therefore<br>
    if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the<br>
    problem. 
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from th orginal to the root<br>
    node.
    </p>
    <p>
    Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of<br>
    recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node<br>
    at the curret=nt level, or stopping it in an array. 
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successfull path:
    </p>
    <pre>
    boolean solve(Node n){
     if n is a leaf node {
       if the leaf is a goal node {
          print n
          return true  
       }
          else return false 
     }else{
      for each child c of n {
         if solve(c) succeeds {
            print n 
            return true
         }
      }
      return false
     }   
    }
    </pre>
    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <p>
    All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty<br>
    cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    for example; if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgae problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate<br>
    solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
    To keep the progra clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In chess game, for example, you could test<br>
    whether a mode is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver method</strong> (or you could call it <strong>isLeaf).</strong> This method would encapsulate all the<br>
    ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have<br>
    been tried already (so we don't have to ry them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <strong>for each child</strong><br>
    <strong>c of n.</strong> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through<br>
    them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each chld of that node can<br>
    represent the arrangement after some piece had made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track<br>
    of which ones you've already examined? 
    </p>
    <p>
    The most straightforward way to keep track of which childrn of node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the<br>
    node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When<br>
    the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure". This is a simple approach, but it may require<br>
    quite a lot of additional work.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an<br>
    ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, you might be able to number the <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried<br>
    <strong>child k,</strong> you know that you hve already tried children 1 through <strong>k-1,</strong> and you have not tried children <strong>k+1</strong> through <strong>n</strong>. Or if you<br>
    are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> If child yellow fails,<br>
    you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight right <strong>(or perhaps<br>
    north, east, south, west).</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    It isn't always easy to find a simple eay to order the children of a node. <strong>In the choices game example,</strong> you might number your<br>
    pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order, but in addition each piece may also have several<br>
    moves, and these must also be ordered.    
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Example: Tree Search</h4>
    <p>
    For starters, let's do the simlplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the<br>
    simplest kind of a tree, a binary tree.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One nide is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point<br>
    to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are reffered to as the left child and/or the right child.<br>
    All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not<br>
    part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The<br>
    first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
    <pre>
    public class BinaryTree {
     BinaryTree leftChild = null;
     BinaryTree rightChild = null;
     boolean isGoalNode = false;
     String name;
     
     BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
      this.name = name;
      leftChild = left;
      rightChild = right;
      this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;  
     }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</p>
    <pre>
    static BinaryTree makeTree() {
      BinaryTree root a, b, c, d, e, f;
      c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);  
      d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);  
      e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);  
      f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);  
      a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
      b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
      root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
      return root;
    }
    </pre>
    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
    <pre>
    public static void main(String args[]) {
     BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
     System.out.println(solvable(tree));   
    }
    </pre>
    <p>And finally, here's the recusrsive backtracking routine to "solve" the bianry tree by finding a goal node.</p>
    <font size="4" color="brown">
      <pre>
      static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
    
      <font color="blue">
        /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;

        /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;

        /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;

        /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;

        /* 5 */ return false;

        }
        </font>
      </pre>
    </font>
    <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol class="side-space">
        <li>
         If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without<br>
        firt checking whether those children actally exist.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> If the node we are given is a goal node, return sucess</li>
        <br>
        <li>
         See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is not-null<br>
        and is not a goal node, says to
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="line-space">This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
    <p>
    Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing is solvable. And<br>
    alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only is they do. Here's that alternative version: 
    </p>
    <pre class="line-space">
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
     
      if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
      
      if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;

      if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;

      return false;

    } 
    </pre>
    <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more effecient.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What are the children?</h3>
    <p>
    One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous<br>
    choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the<br>
    right child are possible soutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediatey, without<br>
    recursion.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theore, of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter<br>
    how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the<br>
    same color.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are<br>
    </p>
    <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <p>&#x2022; Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, chec whether you are at a goal node.</p>
    <p>
    &#x2022; Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of<br>
    countries, you have successfully colored the map.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a<br>
    checkboard only needs two colors.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>boolean maplsOK()</strong><br>
    Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whther the entire map is colored correctly.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    <strong>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</strong><br>
    Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    <strong>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</strong><br>
    Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkboard).
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <pre>
    boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
     
     if (row >= NUM_ROWS) return maplsOK();
     
     map[row][column] = color;

     for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= Blue; nextColor++) {
       
        int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);

        if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
     }

     return false;

    }
    </pre>
    <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <pre>
    boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {
     
      if (row >= NUM_ROWS) return true;
      
      if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
        
           map[row][column] = color;

           for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= Blue; nextColor++) {
             
              int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);

              if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
           }
      }

      return false;

    }
    </pre>
    <p class="line-space">Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they re equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p>
    <table border="1" align="center">

            <th bgcolor="white"></th>
            <th>2 by 3 map</th>

    The zeroes in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of<br>
    these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendants, and this will<br>
    often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential gowth is practically<br>
    guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!
    </p>

    <h3 class="line-space">Debugging techniques</h3>
    <p>
    Often our first try at a problem doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall<br>
    back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. Those tricks can be<br>
    applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space"><strong>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits</strong></p>
    <p>
    Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably<br>
    want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long<br>
    list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space"><strong>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging</strong></p>
    <p>
    Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself<br>
    contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Here's our debugging code. For this trivial progrm, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs<br>
    the proportions will be better.
    </p>
    <pre>
    static String indent = "";
    
    static String name(BinaryTree node) {
       if (node == null) return null;
       else return node.name;  
    }

    static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
      System.out.print(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
      indent = indent + "| ";  
    }

    static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
      indent = indent.substring(3);
      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
      return true; 
    }

    static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
       indent = indent.substring(3);
       System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false");
       return false; 
    }
    </pre>
    <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
    <pre>
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {

    <p><strong>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements</strong></p>
    <p>
    Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debuggging statements as it is to debug<br>
    the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Obviously, yo don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to<br>
    your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be lot of work. What's more, in the above example,<br>
    you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these<br>
    changes, you might introdue new bugs into your program.
    </p>
    <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
    <pre class="line-space">
    static final boolean debugging = false;


    static void enter(BinaryTree node) {

       if (debugging) {

           System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");

           indent = indent + "| ";
       }  
    }


    static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
      
       if (debugging) {

           indent = indent.substring(3);

           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return true");

       }  

       return true;

    }

    static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
      
        if (debugging) {
 
            indent = indent.substring(3);
 
            System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false");
 
        }  
 
        return false;
        
     }
    </pre>
    <p class="line-space">
    In industry, actual pograms often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about<br>
    making your code lager; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can't never be true, and the<br>
    controlled code will be discarded.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Trick #4: Create and Exception.</strong></p>
    <p>
    If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message<br>
    printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.<br>
    However, Java programming don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following<br>
    code.
    </p>
    <pre>
    new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
    </pre>
    <p>
    will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a<br>
    print statement.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-space">

    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,<br>
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. 
    </p>
    <p class="line-space ">
    Now to the program. the main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the<br>
    puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a warning path, or it will fail, and the program will have to<br>
    print out the bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf<br>
    which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board<br>
    position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the position moves from that node<br>
    Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of<br>
    approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way i worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find<br>
    a different but equality valid approaches.
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    First, notice that if a marble has a move, that is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump<br>
    it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and<br>
    check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require<br>
    having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the<br>
    board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attrctive.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a<br>
    particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that<br>
    must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in thaat space has a move, it is unique. There is a sight<br>
    complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unline the marbles) stay in one place. 
    </p>
    <p class="line-space">
    Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each<br>
    space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] move, int<br>
    position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position: 
    </p>
    <p>&#x2022; If the position is empty, no move is possible.</p>
    <p>&#x2022; If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a mov or jump to the right.</p>
    <p>&#x2022; If the position is empty, no move is possible.</p>
    <p class="line-space">
    We write another method <strong>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</strong> that will take a board and a position, make a move from<br>
    that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more effeciantly by changing the old board,<br>
    rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jagron, makeMove is "applicative"<br>
    tather than "mutative".
    </p>
    <p>
    Along with <strong>canMove and nakedMove,</strong> we are using methods <strong>puzzleSolved and printBoard</strong> with meanings that<br>
    should be obvious.
